- sqlalchemy 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The final result of this project is a webapp that classify a message that is generated by user in the time of disaster. Therefore, disaster response team can quickly capture the massage and allocate resource for the disaster area. The project is started with data cleaning, follow-up by training a machine learning model, and finally deploy the model on the web app. 
In this project I applied date engineering, natural language processing and machine learning skill

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There three main component in the files:
1. data
    - disaster_categories.csv: dataset mentioning all the disaster categories map to message id
    - disaster_messages.csv: dataset including all the messages
    - process_data.py: ETL pipeline scripts to read, clean, and save data into a database
    - DisasterResponse.db: ETL pipeline results, i.e. the SQLite database that contain clean data from .csv
2. models
    - train_classifier.py: machine learning pipeline scripts to train and export a classifier
    - classifier.pkl: results of machine learning pipeline, i.e. a trained classifer
3. app
    - run.py: Flask file to run the web application
    - templates contains html file for the web application


## Results<a name="results"></a>
1. process_data.py will produce DisasterResponse.db a clean data to train machine learning model
2. train_classifier.py will produce classifier.pkl a machine learning model that classify a message to which categories
3. A Flask app by running run.py, a web app that receive a message and show the classification of that messages

Here's the web app when it initially starts.

Here's the results example if we classify this message **"Help! We just encounter an earthquake"**. The app classify the message as **related, aid related, weather related, and earthquake**

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credits must be given to Udacity for the starter codes and FigureEight for provding the data used by this project.

## Instructions:<a name="instructions"></a>
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline which read data from 2 csv files and store it into database 
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline which trains classifier and save the model as pickle file
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
